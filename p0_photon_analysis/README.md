# Introduction to pi0 and photon analysis in PHENIX

This packages contains data, description and code samples illustrating neutral meson and photon analysis. A set of Ntuples derived from actual PHENIX data is provided.

* pi0ntup_v1 - the original version of the write-up based on files containing different types of ntuples; also requires "revtex" so won't compule on some systems
* pi0ntup_v2 - simpler TeX code, take into account refactored Ntuples
